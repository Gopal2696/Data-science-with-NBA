# Data-science-with-NBA
NBA and anlytics is something that amazes me, So I thought why don't merge them both.
Therefore I made this project that uses Matplotlib, scikit, seaborn to visualize the data and uses Numpy, pandas to Manipulate and preprocess the Data
 
 # Data file
The data file name is all_seasons.csv and I have uploaded it on the github.do check!.
The data contains 20 years of the data about the NBA players.


# HOW TO RUN
The file with .ipynb can be run using Jupyter notebook.
